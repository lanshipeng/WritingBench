evaluate_prompt = """
Evaluate the Drama based on the Query and Criteria provided following the Scoring Rules.

** Scoring Rules **

"1-2": "Low score description: Critical deficiencies and major issues that prevent adequate functionality.",
"3-4": "Below average score description: Lacking with noticeable shortcomings that impact overall effectiveness and require improvement.",
"5-6": "Average score description: Adequate but not exemplary, Baseline performance that meets essential requirements. Most models may achieve this score.",
"7-8": "Above average score description: Strong performance characterized by competent execution, though minor refinements are needed to achieve excellence.",
"9-10": "High score description: Exceptional performance with all aspects optimally addressed, demonstrating superior effectiveness and quality without any flaws."

-Provide reasons for each score by indicating specific strengths or deficiencies within the Drama. Reference exact text passages to justify the score, ensuring that each reason is concrete and aligns with the criteria requirements while highlighting key gaps from the ideal answer.

-Be very STRICT and do not be misled by format or length; ensure that the Drama is thoroughly evaluated beyond superficial appearances.

-Carefully discern whether the content of the Drama is an illusion, appearing substantial but actually entirely fabricated.

-Sometimes the model may only provide an introduction or an overview without truly completing the query, which should be considered a failed response. Carefully discern this.

-Scoring Range: Assign an integer score between 1 to 10
